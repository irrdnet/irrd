=============
Configuration
=============

IRRd reads its configuration from a YAML file in a specified location. Many
configuration options can be changed without restarting IRRd, but not all.

Loading and reloading
---------------------

The configuration is loaded when IRRd starts. The path to the config file is read from the ``IRRD_CONFIG_PATH``
environment variable. If the configuration is invalid, the daemon will refuse to start.
While running, the configuration can be reloaded by sending a `SIGHUP` signal. Most settings will take effect
immediately, but some require a full restart. If a `SIGHUP` is sent and the new configuration is invalid,
errors will be written to the logfile, but IRRd will keep running with the last valid configuration.
A successful reload after a `SIGHUP` is also logged.

.. important::

    Not all configuration errors are caught when reloading, such as making IRRd bind to a TCP port that
    is already in use. An incorrect password for the PostgreSQL database is only detected when IRRd
    restarts and attempts to connect.

Configuration options
---------------------

Database
~~~~~~~~
* ``database_url``: a RFC1738 PostgreSQL database URL for the database used by IRRd, e.g.
  ``postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/irrd`` to connect to `localhost` on port 5432, database `irrd`,
  username `username`, password `password`.
  |br| **Default**: not defined, but required.
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after full IRRd restart.

Servers
~~~~~~~
* ``server.[whois|http].interface``: the network interface on which the whois or HTTP interface will listen
  |br| **Default**: `::0`
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after full IRRd restart.
* ``server.[whois|http].port``: the port on which the whois or HTTP interface will listen
  |br| **Default**: 43 for whois, 80 for HTTP.
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after full IRRd restart.
* ``server.[whois|http].access_list``: a reference to an access list in the configuration, where only IPs in the access
  list are permitted access. If not defined, all access is permitted for whois, but all access is denied for HTTP.
  |br| **Default**: not defined, all access permitted for whois, all access denied for HTTP
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP.
* ``server.whois.max_connections``: the maximum number of simultaneous whois connections permitted
  |br| **Default**: 50
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP. Existing connections will not be terminated.

Email
~~~~~
* ``email.from``: the `From` email address used when sending emails
  |br| **Default**: not defined, but required
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, for all subsequent emails
* ``email.footer``: a footer to include in all emails
  |br| **Default**: empty string
  |br| **Change takes effect**:  after SIGHUP, for all subsequent emails
* ``email.smtp``: the SMTP server to use for outbound emails
  |br| **Default**: not defined, but required
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, for all subsequent emails

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``auth.override_password``: a salted MD5 hash of the override password, which can be used to override any
  authorisation requirements for authoritative databases
  |br| **Default**: not defined, no override password will be accepted
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP
* ``auth.gnupg_keyring``: the full path to the gnupg keyring
  |br| **Default**: not defined, but required
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after full IRRd restart

.. danger::

    IRRd loads keys into the gnupg keyring when `key-cert` objects are imported. Their presence in the
    keyring is then used to validate requested changes. Therefore, the keyring referred to by
    ``auth.gnupg_keyring`` can not be simply reset, or PGP authentications may fail.


Access lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``access_lists.{list_name}``: a list of permitted IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses and/or prefixes, which will be
  permitted access for any service that refers to access list ``{list_name}``
  |br| **Default**: no lists defined
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, for all subsequent requests

Sources
~~~~~~~
* ``sources_default``: a list of sources that are enabled by default, or when a user selects all sources
  with ``-a``. The order of this list defines the search priority as well. It is not required to include
  all known sources in the default selection.
  |br| **Default**: not defined. All sources are enabled, but results are not ordered by source.
  |br| **Change takes effect**:
* ``sources.{name}``: settings for a particular source.
* ``sources.{name}.authoritative``: a boolean for whether this source is authoritative, i.e. changes are allowed
  to be submitted to this IRRd instance through e.g. email updates
  |br| **Default**: ``false``
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, for all subsequent requests.
* ``sources.{name}.keep_journal``: a boolean for whether a local journal is retained of changes to objects from
  this source. This journal can contain changes submitted to this IRRd instance, or changes received over NRTM.
  This setting is needed when offering mirroring services for this source. Can only be enabled when either
  ``authoritative`` is enabled, or all three of ``nrtm_host``, ``nrtm_port`` and ``import_serial_source``.
  |br| **Default**: ``false``
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, for all subsequent changes.
* ``sources.{name}.nrtm_host``: the hostname or IP to connect to for an NRTM stream
  |br| **Default**: not defined, no NRTM requests attempted
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, at the next NRTM update.
* ``sources.{name}.nrtm_port``: the TCP port to connect to for an NRTM stream
  |br| **Default**: not defined, no NRTM requests attempted
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, at the next NRTM update.
* ``sources.{name}.import_source``: the FTP URL or list of URLs where the full copies of this source can be
  retrieved. You can provide a list of URLs for sources that offer split files.
  |br| **Default**: not defined, no imports attempted
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, at the next full import. This will only occur if this source is
  forced to reload, i.e. changing this URL will not cause a new full import by itself in sources that use NRTM.
  For sources that do not use NRTM, every mirror update is a full import.
* ``sources.{name}.import_serial_source``: the FTP URL where the file with serial belonging to the ``import_source``
  can be retrieved
  |br| **Default**: not defined, no imports attempted
  |br| **Change takes effect**: see ``import_source``.
* ``sources.{name}.import_timer``: the time between two updates, either by full import or NRTM.
  This is particularly significant for sources that do not offer an NRTM stream, as they will instead run a 
  full import every time this timer expires. The default is rather frequent for sources that work exclusively 
  with periodic full imports.
  |br| **Default**: 300 
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP
* ``sources.{name}.object_class_filter``: a list of object classes that will be mirrored. Objects of other RPSL object
  classes will be ignored. Without a filter, all objects are mirrored.
  |br| **Default**: no filter, all object classes permitted
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, at the next NRTM update or full import.
* ``sources.{name}.export_destination``: a path to save full exports, including a serial file, of this source
  |br| **Default**: not defined, no exports made.
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP, at the next ``export_timer``
* ``sources.{name}.export_timer``: the time between two full exports
  |br| **Default**: 3600
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP

There are fundamentally two different ways to mirror other databases:

* **NRTM mode**: providing a location to download full copies of the database, the serial belonging to
  that copy, and then updating this using an NRTM stream. This method is recommended, as it is efficient
  and allows IRRd to generate a journal, if enabled, so that others can mirror the source from this
  IRRd instance too.

* **Periodic full import mode**: providing a location to download full copies of the database, and no
  other details. Every ``import_timer``, the entire database will be reloaded from the full copies.
  Journals can not be generated.

.. caution::

    **Journal-keeping is the only full object history that is kept of the database, and is therefore strongly
    recommended to enable on authoritative databases to be able to reconstruct history.**

    Journal-keeping for NRTM streams is dependent on providing a single uninterrupted stream of updates.
    This stream is only kept while ``keep_journal`` is enabled. Disabling it while mirrors are dependent
    on it, even briefly, will cause the databases to go out of sync silently until the mirror
    runs a new full import.

.. note::

    Source names are case sensitive and must be an exact match to ``sources_default``, and the source
    attribute value in any objects imported from files or NRTM. E.g. if ``sources.EXAMPLE`` is defined,
    and ``sources_default`` contains ``example``, this is a configuration error. If an object is
    encountered with ``source: EXAMPLe``, it is rejected and an error is logged.


Logging
~~~~~~~
* ``log.logfile_path``: the full path where the logfile will be written. IRRd will attempt to create the file if it
  does not exist. If the file is removed, e.g. by a log rotation process, IRRd will create a new file in the same
  location, and continue writing to the new file. Timestamps in logs are always in UTC, regardless of local machine
  timezone.
  |br| **Default**: not defined, logs will be sent to the console
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after full IRRd restart.
* ``log.level``: the loglevel, one of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. The recommended level is `INFO`.
  |br| **Default**: `INFO`
  |br| **Change takes effect**: after SIGHUP.
