Notable changes
---------------
* :doc:`RPKI-aware mode </admins/rpki>` is now available, where IRRd
  imports RPKI ROAs and can filter or reject RPSL objects that are
  in conflict with ROAs. Pseudo-IRR objects are generated for all ROAs.
* When RPKI-aware mode is enabled, ``RPKI`` becomes an invalid as a regular
  IRR source name, as it is reserved for pseudo-IRR objects from ROAs.
* The preloader for ``!g``, ``!6``, ``!a`` and in some cases ``!i`` queries
  has slightly improved performance.
* HTTP(s) downloads are now supported for the ``sources.{name}.import_source``
  and ``sources.{name}.import_serial_source`` settings.

Upgrade notes
-------------
By default, RPKI-aware mode is disabled. Objects that are invalid when compared
to ROAs are not detected, and query responses are unchanged until
:doc:`RPKI-aware mode is enabled </admins/rpki>`.

IRRd 4.1.0 includes several database migrations to support RPKI-aware mode,
whether enabled or disabled, and facilitate performance improvements needed
for RPKI-aware mode. Running these migrations is required to run IRRd 4.1.0,
even if RPKI-aware mode is never enabled.

Running the migrations is done using the same command as
:ref:`creating the tables initially in deployment <deployment-database-upgrade>`.

.. caution::
    Some of the migrations change large amounts of data, and may take up to an
    hour to run in total. While the migrations are running, IRRd should be
    shut down and any cron / e-mail triggered tasks should be disabled.
