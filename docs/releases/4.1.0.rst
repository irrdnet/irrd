============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.1.0
============================

IRRd 4.1.0 adds :doc:`RPKI-aware mode </admins/rpki>`
and a new daemon architecture with full multiprocessing,
along with several other improvements.

Upgrading to IRRd 4.1.0 requires several changes to the deployment setup.
This page contains details on the changes compared to
IRRd 4.0, and how to upgrade.

New features
------------

RPKI-aware mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:doc:`RPKI-aware mode </admins/rpki>` is now available, where IRRd
imports RPKI ROAs and can filter or reject RPSL objects that are
in conflict with ROAs. Pseudo-IRR objects are generated for all ROAs.
When RPKI-aware mode is enabled, ``RPKI`` becomes an invalid as a regular
IRR source name, as it is reserved for pseudo-IRR objects from ROAs.
RPKI-aware mode also affects mirroring.

IRRd 4.1.0 includes several database migrations to support RPKI-aware mode,
whether enabled or disabled, and facilitate performance improvements needed
for RPKI-aware mode. Running these migrations is required to run IRRd 4.1.0,
even if RPKI-aware mode is never enabled.

.. danger::
    The impact of running IRRd in RPKI-aware mode can be dramatic, and it is
    strongly recommended to read the
    :doc:`RPKI integration </admins/rpki>` documentation very carefully
    before enabling it, to understand all consequences.
    **By default, RPKI-aware mode is enabled**.
    RPKI-aware mode can be disabled entirely, or certain sources can be
    excluded from RPKI validation.

New daemon architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IRRd has a new daemon architecture, where all whois queries, HTTP requests,
mirror processes and the preloader run in their own process. This improves
performance significantly, especially where many processes are running
on servers with many cores. Previously, the entire IRRd process was limited
to one CPU core.

To communicate between processes, IRRd now requires a running Redis instance.
The commands to start IRRd and several IRRd scripts have also changed.
The ``--uid`` parameter is no longer supported.

Synthetic NRTM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``irrd_load_database`` command allowed loading RPSL data from local files,
often used to load data generated by scripts or other systems. Data imported
this way could not be mirrored over NRTM.

In IRRd 4.1, the ``irrd_update_database`` command has been added. This
supports periodically updating a source to the state in a particular file,
and automatically generates journal entries for any differences, allowing
NRTM mirroring. See the :doc:`mirroring documentation </users/mirroring>`
for further details.

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Serial handling in IRRd has changed. If you mirror a source over NRTM, and
  keep a local journal, IRRd used to keep these serials identical. The NRTM
  ADD from the original source would be stored in the local journal under the
  same serial number, unless it was ignored by the object class filter.
  In 4.1, IRRd always keeps its own range of serials. That means serials for
  the same change may be different between different mirrors.
  If users change their NRTM source to a different one, they should reload the
  entire database from that source, not just resume NRTM streaming. Simply
  changing the NRTM host may lead to missing data.
* IRRd starts a maximum of three mirror processes at the same time,
  to reduce peak loads. A further three, if needed, are started 15 seconds
  later, regardless of whether the previous ones have finished.
* HTTP(s) downloads are now supported for the ``sources.{name}.import_source``
  and ``sources.{name}.import_serial_source`` settings.
* A number of new configuration options were added, and some are required.
  See the :doc:`configuration documentation </admins/configuration>` for more
  information on these options.
* A timeout was added for FTP connections.
* A bug was fixed where some invalid objects could cause parser exceptions.


Steps required to upgrade
-------------------------
The following steps are required to upgrade to IRRd 4.1.0, regardless of
whether RPKI-aware mode is enabled or not.

* Disable all cron and e-mail triggered tasks. There should be no calls
  to any IRRd scripts during the upgrade process.
* Upgrade the IRRd package from within the virtualenv with
  ``pip install -U irrd``
* Install a Redis instance as documented in the
  :ref:`deployment guide <deployment-redis-configuration>` and configure
  the ``redis_url`` setting.
* Note that unix sockets are strongly recommended over TCP sockets for both
  PostgreSQL and Redis, for improved performance. The effect of this is more
  significant with the new multi-process daemon architecture.
* Set ``piddir`` to a directory where IRRd can write its PID file, ``irrd.pid``.
* Run the database migrations, using the same command used to
  :ref:`create the tables initially in deployment <deployment-database-upgrade>`.
  **Important note**: some of the migrations change large amounts of data,
  and may take up to 15-45 minutes to run in total. While the migrations are
  running, IRRd should be shut down and any cron / e-mail triggered tasks
  must be disabled. There must be no calls to ``irrd_submit_email`` or
  ``irrd_load_database``.
* Update any startup scripts or systemd for IRRd to call the new daemon process,
  with the new command line arguments, and use ``setcap`` to allow IRRd to bind
  to privileged ports: see the
  :ref:`updated deployment guide <deployment-starting-irrd>`.
* Remove the ``--irrd_pidfile`` parameter from calls to ``irrd_submit_email`` and
  ``irrd_load_database``.
* Ensure that RPKI-aware mode is configured as desired. By default it is
  **enabled**.
* Start IRRd and re-enable the cron / e-mail triggered tasks.
