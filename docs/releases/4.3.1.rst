Release notes for IRRd 4.3.1
============================

IRRd 4.3.1 was released on August 17, 2023, and fixes several issues:

* Set members included through ``mbrs-by-ref`` / ``member-of`` did not
  have the correct source filter applied. This meant that members could
  be included in a set, even through the `aut-num`, `route` or
  `route6` object were from a different IRR source.
* IRRD could incorrectly try to use synchronised serials even when
  route object preference was enabled. This could cause issues for
  mirrored sources when this setting was enabled, but RPKI and the
  scope filter were not. If this affected your setup, mirroring would
  break, but IRRD would log errors repeatedly.
* The PyYAML dependency was updated to 6.0.1 to resolve installation
  issues in certain environments.
