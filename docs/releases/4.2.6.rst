Release notes for IRRd 4.2.6
============================

IRRd 4.2.6 was released on November 18th, 2022, and fixes two issues:

* IRRD whois connections could `stay stuck in FIN_WAIT2`_ state,
  which may also have lead to `workers to stop responding`_ to
  queries in some cases. This was addressed by adding a missing
  timeout to read calls on these connections.
* A few small changes were made to improve unclear log messages.
