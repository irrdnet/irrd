============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.2.0
============================

* The optional ``geofeed`` attribute was added for `inetnum` and `inet6num`
  objects, which can contain a URL which in turn contains geographical
  information, as defined in `draft-ymbk-opsawg-finding-geofeeds-03`_.
* Retrieval of files over FTP now follows the ``ftp_proxy`` environment
  variable, if set.
