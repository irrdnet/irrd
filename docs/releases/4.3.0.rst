============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.3.0
============================

New password hasher and new password settings
---------------------------------------------
IRRd 4 has always supported CRYPT-PW and MD5-PW hashing for passwords in
_mntner_ objects. This version adds support for BCRYPT-PW, using bcrypt,
a secure and modern password hashing method.

IRRd 4.3 has a new setting ``auth.password_hashers`` which lets you configure
which password hashes are enabled. **The default is stricter than in
older versions**: ``bcrypt-pw`` and ``md5-pw`` are fully enabled, 
``crypt-pw`` is only enabled in legacy mode. The legacy mode means that IRRd
will accept authentication through CRYPT-PW on `mntners` as before, but will
not accept ``auth`` lines using CRYPT-PW on new or modified `mntner`
objects in authoritative databases. This requires users to upgrade to
a stronger hash when they next update their `mntner` object.


Changes to related object authentication and settings
-----------------------------------------------------
In version 4.2, IRRd required newly created authoritative `as-set` objects
to have a hierarchical name where the first element is an AS number.
In 4.3, this feature has been significantly expanded.

For all RPSL set objects, IRRd can now be configured to require:

* Including an ASN prefix in the name of the set, e.g. ``AS65537:AS-EXAMPLE``
  being valid, but ``AS-EXAMPLE`` being invalid.
* Passing authentication for the corresponding `aut-num`, e.g. AS65537 in the
  example, skipping this check if the `aut-num` does not exist.
* Passing authentication for the corresponding `aut-num`, e.g. AS65537 in the
  example, failing this check if the `aut-num` does not exist.

The first two options, requiring a prefix with opportunistic `aut-num` authentication,
is now the default for all set objects.
You can :ref:`change the configuration <conf-auth-set-creation>` for specific
RPSL set objects, or set your own common configuration that applies to all sets.

The ``compatibility.permit_non_hierarchical_as_set_name`` setting has been
removed, as it is now covered by the ``prefix_required`` setting.

The ``auth.authenticate_related_mntners`` setting has been renamed to 
``auth.authenticate_parents_route_creation``, as this setting exclusively
relates to :ref:`authentication for route(6) objects <auth-related-mntners-route>`
and needs to be distinct from the configuration for RPSL set objects.

If you were using ``auth.authenticate_related_mntners`` or 
``compatibility.permit_non_hierarchical_as_set_name``, you need to update
your configuration.

All checks are only applied when users create new set objects in authoritative
databases. Authoritative updates to existing objects, deletions, or objects from
mirrors are never affected. When looking for related objects,
IRRd only looks in the same IRR source.

Support for maintainer suspension
---------------------------------
IRRd now supports
:doc:`suspending a maintainer and all objects it maintains </admins/suspension>`.
This feature is only accessible to admins using the override password, and only
when enabled on an authoritative source with the ``suspension_enabled`` setting.

Suspended objects act as if they have been deleted, but can be restored by an
admin at a later time.
