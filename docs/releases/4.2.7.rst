Release notes for IRRd 4.2.7
============================

IRRd 4.2.7 was released on February 15th, 2023, and has three changes:

* IRRd now has a new setting ``sources.{name}.nrtm_query_serial_range_limit``
  to limit the maximum serial range a client may request in a single NRTM
  query. This is configured per source, and evaluated in addition to
  other access limits. By default, there is no limit.
  See the :doc:`configuration documentation </admins/configuration>`
  for details.
* Each IRRd process will now log a traceback of all threads when receiving
  a SIGUSR1 signal. The tracebacks are written to the normal logs, and
  can help IRRd developers understand more complex issues, particularly
  in hanging IRRd workers.
* Password hashes were `visible in some email notifications`_. The scope
  was limited. A notification could only be triggered by already
  knowing a valid password.
