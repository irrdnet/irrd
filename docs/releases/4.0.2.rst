============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.0.2
============================

IRRd 4.0.2 includes one bugfix and two enhancements:

* A `bug in IPv4 addresses in access lists`_. IPv6-mapped
  IPv4 addresses would be rejected, even when they were
  listed in the access list.
* `Ignoring of *xx object classes`_, even in strict mode,
  as these are harmless artefacts sometimes produced by
  legacy IRRd versions.
* `Adding an irrd_mirror_force_reload`_ command, to force
  a reload of a particular mirror. The ``irrd_load_data``
  command was not well suited for this, and the documentation
  provides guidance on when to use which command.

IRRd 4.0.2 is entirely backwards compatible with 4.0.0.
