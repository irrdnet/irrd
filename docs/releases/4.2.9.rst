============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.2.9
============================

IRRd 4.2.9 was released on August 17, 2023, and fixes several issues:

* Set members included through ``mbrs-by-ref`` / ``member-of`` did not
  have the correct source filter applied. This meant that members could
  be included in a set, even through the `aut-num`, `route` or
  `route6` object were from a different IRR source.
* The PyYAML dependency was updated to 6.0.1 to resolve installation
  issues in certain environments.
