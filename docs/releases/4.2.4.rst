============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.2.4
============================

IRRd 4.2.4 was released on April 5th, 2022, and fixes
`an issue where the source order was not correctly applied`_.

This could affect the results of queries like ``!i`` and ``!m`` and their
GraphQL counterparts, which only return or consider one object, while multiple
objects with the same primary key may exist in different sources.
Where these multiple objects did exist, the responses to the queries could
prefer the object from a less preferred source. This behaviour was not
always consistent.

This affected both the source order set in the ``sources_default`` setting
and an explicit source order set for a specific query.
