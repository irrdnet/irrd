==================================
DRAFT Release notes for IRRD 4.5.0
==================================

NRTMv4
------
IRRD 4.5 adds support for NRTMv4_, a new IRR mirroring protocol based
on JSON-ish files over HTTPS. It is now the recommended method of
mirroring to/from other databases. It is more reliable, secure, detects
errors, has less opportunities for misconfiguration, and recovers
automatically from loss of synchronisation.

A single IRRD instance can mix NRTMv3, NRTMv4 and authoritative databases,
so gradual upgrades are possible.
There are several new settings to enable NRTMv4. You will also need to
be aware of key management.
For all details, see the :doc:`mirroring documentation </users/mirroring>`.

New irt and organisation object classes
---------------------------------------
The `irt` and `organisation` object classes were added. This means that
in authoritative databases, users can now create these objects, and IRRD
will include these objects when mirroring other sources.
**By default, support for these classes is enabled.**
To restore the old behaviour, you can use the
``sources.{name}.object_class_filter`` setting, which now also applies
to authoritative databases.
You can query the templates using the ``-t`` whois query or see all
supported classes in the GraphQL schema.

New Prometheus metrics
----------------------
A :doc:`Prometheus-compatible metrics page </admins/prometheus-metrics>`
was added to the HTTP server in IRRD, on ``/metrics/``.
This page is only accessible to IPs :doc:`configured </admins/configuration>`
in the access list set in the ``server.http.status_access_list`` setting.

RPSL object text dummification for exports and NRTM
---------------------------------------------------
IRRD can now dummify RPSL object text in exports and NRTM, to remove
sensitive or personal information. This is controlled by the new
``sources.{name}.nrtm_dummified_object_classes`` and
``sources.{name}.nrtm_dummified_attributes`` settings.

Dummification applies to exports, NRTMv3 responses, and NRTMv4. It does
not apply to interactive query responses like whois or GraphQL.
By default, dummification is disabled.

New "RPSL data updated" status timestamp
----------------------------------------
Various status overviews of IRRD would show a "last update" per source.
While there are uses for this, many users checked this to ensure mirroring
from a remote source was still active. However, that is not what this
indicates. This timestamp updates for any internal change to database
status, including any exports.

To cover the common use, a new timestamp was added for the last time
the RPSL data for a source changed. This updates when objects are added,
modified or deleted through any method, including a change in visibility
due to object suppression status.

Minimum Python version and PyPy
-------------------------------
The minimum Python version for IRRd is now 3.9. Python 3.8 is end of life
as of 7 October 2024 and therefore no longer supported.

Other changes
-------------
* The RPSL update submission page, on `/rpsl/update/`, now also accepts
  inline PGP signed messages for mntner authentication.
* The ``sources.{name}.object_class_filter`` setting can now also be used
  to restrict permitted changes to authoritative objects.
* The setting ``sources.{name}.authoritative_retain_last_modified`` was
  added to skip updating `last-modified` in authoritative databases,
  and retain the original value (if any) instead.
* When a user submits an update to an authoritative object, which is identical to
  the current version, these changes are no longer saved.
  This means they do not create a journal entry.
  They are included in reports and notifications to the submitter and maintainers,
  with an info message. The `last-modified` field is ignored when determining
  if the object has changed, except when
  ``sources.{name}.authoritative_retain_last_modified`` is set for the source.
  Processing of other updates, such as those received from mirrors, is not
  affected.
* Deleted objects no longer have to meet all strict validation requirements.
  This makes it easier to delete objects created under a legacy IRRD that
  do not meet current validation requirements. Authentication requirements
  have not been changed.
* Authoritative creation or updating of route(6) objects for 0.0.0.0/0,
  0.0.0.0/32, ::/0 and ::/128 is no longer allowed.
* The ``sources.{name}.nrtm_query_serial_days_limit`` setting was added to
  limit the age of the oldest serial that can be requested over NRTMv3.
* The ``irrd_update_database`` command now starts counting serials from
  the serial provided to a previous ``irrd_load_database``.
* The combination of ``readonly_standby`` and ``sources.{name}.export_destination``
  is explicitly invalid in the configuration.
* The ``sources.{name}.authoritative_non_strict_mode_dangerous`` setting
  was added, to force an authoritative database into non-strict mode.
  As it's name notes, this disables many checks and all referential integrity
  and is therefore strongly discouraged.
* Most non-printable characters are now stripped from all RPSL attribute values.
* The order in which authoritative sources are listed in the select field in
  the maintainer migration form now follows the order of the configuration
  file. Previously, this was alphabetically ordered.
