============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.4.4
============================

IRRd 4.4.4 was released on April 25th, 2024, and has several fixes/improvements:

* `Startup could fail`_ when using the user/group settings. This happened because of
  an incorrect log file access check.
* `Deletes are now non-strict`_ which means legacy objects that are currently
  not valid can be deleted without fixing the object first.
* The irr_rpsl_submit command could `log an RPSL password`_ for certain failures.
