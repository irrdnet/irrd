==================================
DRAFT Release notes for IRRd 4.4.0
==================================

Minimum Python version
----------------------
The minimum Python version for IRRd is now 3.8. Python 3.7 is `end of life`_
as of 27 June 2023 and therefore no longer supported.

IRRD internal authentication
----------------------------
IRRD 4.4 contains a new web interface (on ``/ui/``)
that allows users to migrate their authoritative maintainers
to an IRRD internal authentication method. It also offers more secure
alternatives to email submissions and override access.

You can allow migrations with the
``auth.irrd_internal_migration_enabled`` setting.
By default, this is disabled.
Even with migration disabled, users can use the object submission
interface to submit in the same format as email, by including the
``password`` or ``override`` pseudo-attributes.

Independent of whether regular users can migrate their account
(``auth.irrd_internal_migration_enabled``), you can
use the web interface to provide more secure override access.

For full details, see the
:doc:`web interface and internal authentication documentation </admins/webui/>`

This new feature adds two new required settings, with no default set:

* ``secret_key``, which must be a random secret string, used to protect
  session data and tokens in emails.
* ``server.http.url``, which must be the external URL on which users will
  reach the IRRD instance, used for WebAuthn second factor authentication.
  This must match the URL as seen from the browser's perspective,
  and changing it will invalidate all WebAuthn tokens.


New recommendations on availability and replication
---------------------------------------------------
Historically, operators have used different methods for synchronising
an active instance of IRRD with a standby, or doing migrations.
Some of these had issues around serial synchronisation, object suppression, or
update frequency.

There is now one recommended method for synchronisation between IRRD 4 instances,
and new documentation on
:doc:`availability with PostgreSQL replication </admins/availability-and-migration>`.

The ``database_readonly`` setting was removed, in favour of a new
``readonly_standby`` setting. The settings are similar but have some differences,
and this is an intentional breaking change as you will need specific
PostgreSQL configuration for this to work correctly.


Upgrading to IRRd 4.4.0 from 4.3.x
----------------------------------
TODO


Downgrading from 4.4 to 4.3.x
-----------------------------
If you are running IRRd 4.4, and would like to downgrade back to 4.3.x,
the database schema needs to be modified. You can either restore an older
copy of your database, start with a fresh database, or use the database
migrations.

If you want to use the database migrations, run this command **before**
downgrading your local package installation to 4.3.x::

    irrd_database_downgrade --version TODO-TODO

If you would like to re-upgrade to 4.4 later on, you will need to run
the database migrations again, as listed in the upgrade steps.
