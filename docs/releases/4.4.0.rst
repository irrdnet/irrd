DRAFT Release notes for IRRd 4.4.0
==================================

Minimum Python version
----------------------
The minimum Python version for IRRd is now 3.8. Python 3.7 is `end of life`_
as of 27 June 2023 and therefore no longer supported.

Upgrading to IRRd 4.4.0 from 4.3.x
----------------------------------
TODO


Downgrading from 4.4 to 4.3.x
-----------------------------
If you are running IRRd 4.4, and would like to downgrade back to 4.3.x,
the database schema needs to be modified. You can either restore an older
copy of your database, start with a fresh database, or use the database
migrations.

If you want to use the database migrations, run this command **before**
downgrading your local package installation to 4.3.x::

    irrd_database_downgrade --version TODO-TODO

If you would like to re-upgrade to 4.4 later on, you will need to run
the database migrations again, as listed in the upgrade steps.
