            This AS{asn} route object represents routing data retrieved
            from the RPKI. This route object is the result of an automated
            RPKI-to-IRR conversion process performed by IRRd.
        notify_invalid_subject: route(6) objects in {sources_str} marked RPKI invalid
        notify_invalid_header: |
            This is to notify that {object_count} route(6) objects for which you are a
            contact have been marked as RPKI invalid. This concerns
            objects in the {sources_str} database.

            You have received this message because your e-mail address is
            listed in one or more of the tech-c or admin-c contacts, on
            the maintainer(s) for these route objects.

            The {object_count} route(6) objects listed below have been validated using
            RPKI origin validation, and found to be invalid. This means that
            these objects are no longer visible on the IRRd instance that
            sent this e-mail.

            This may affect routing filters based on queries to this IRRd
            instance. It is also no longer possible to modify these objects.

            To resolve this situation, create or modify ROA objects that
            result in these route(6) being valid, or not_found. If this
            happens, the route(6) objects will return to being visible.
            You may also delete these objects if they are no longer
            relevant.

            This is to notify you of changes in the {sources_str} database
            or object authorisation failures.

            You may receive this message because you are listed in
            the notify attribute on the changed object(s), because
            you are listed in the mnt-nfy or upd-to attribute on a maintainer
            of the object(s), or the upd-to attribute on the maintainer of a
            parent of newly created object(s).
